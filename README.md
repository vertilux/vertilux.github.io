# VTX API Documentation

## Introduction

VTX API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another!

## Authentication

To get started using VTX's API platform, you'll need a valid API key. All authenticated API requests should have a header value `X-Api-Key` set with this key.

If you're a Vertilux's customer and don't have an API key, please contact [it support](https://chat.vertilux.com).
